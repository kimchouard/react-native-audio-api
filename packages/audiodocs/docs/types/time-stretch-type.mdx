# TimeStretchType

`TimeStretchType` type specifies algorithm which will be used during time-stretching(changing speed of the playback).

**Acceptable values:**
  - `'linear'`

  Use naive linear approach while time-stretching the sound.

  - `'speech-music'`

  Use sophisticated algorithm with pitch correction while time-stretching the sound

:::caution

On `Web`, the value of `timeStretch` is permanently `'linear'`, and it cannot be set like on the `Android` or `iOS`.
